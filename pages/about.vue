      <p class="description">I created this site as a portfolio piece for my final year project. I'm currently studying Web Design and Development. This project makes use of Nuxt, a JavaScript framework built on Vue.js and the Punk API. None of the imagery used is my own and the site is purely for educational purposes.</p>
